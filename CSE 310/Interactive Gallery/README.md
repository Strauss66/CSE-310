# Overview

In this project I started to learn a little bit of what the basic concepts of html, css and javascript to create an interactive art gallery with some useful links.

The javascripts select an array of URLs (i didn't put the urls becasue the pictures were downloaded from pexels.com) and when you slide you mouse on top of it you can click and be send to the page to get the painting or know more about the artist.

The purpose was to practice and create an interactive webpage using javascript.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
